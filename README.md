# Great Number Game
This is a number guesser web-app built with Python/Flask
### Objectives:
* Create a new Flask project called great_number_game
* In the root route, save a random number between 1 and 100 and display a form for the user to guess the number
* Create a route that determines whether the number submitted is too high, too low, or correct. Show this status on the HTML page.
* Display the results as shown in the wireframe above (i.e. with appropriate colors and positioning)
* Allow the user to keep guessing until they get it correct
* Let the user know how many attempts they took before guessing the correct number
* Only allow the user to guess up to 5 times. If they don't guess it on their 5th attempt, display a "You Lose" message and allow them to try again.
* If they win, allow the user to submit their name. Have a link to a leaderboard page that shows winners' names and how many attempts they took to guess correctly.
